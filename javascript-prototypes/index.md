## What is a Prototype ?

A prototype is just an object that is referenced by _other_ objects via an
internal property. This allows those other objects access to properties (including
functions) which are actually set on the prototype object. The JavaScript spec
calls the internal property "`[[Prototype]]` internal slot"
[(ยง 9.1)](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-ordinary-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots)
and it is _not_ the same thing as the `prototype` property; more on this later. When we say that
"`foo` is prototype-linked to `bar`" it means that `foo`'s internal
`[[Prototype]]` is a reference to `bar`; therefore, `foo` will have access to `bar`'s properties.

## Default Prototype Links

You probably know that all objects somehow have access to functions like `toString()` and `hasOwnProperty()`, without
you having to do anything. This is because all objects have `Object.prototype` in their prototype chain by default,
and properties are resolved recursively. If an object doesn't have the property we're trying to access,
the prototype chain will be traversed until it is found, or `undefined` is returned. `Object.prototype` is
normally the last link in the prototype chain, and it's `[[Prototype]]` is `null`.

```js
const foo = { x: 42 } // by default, foo is prototype-linked to Object.prototype
Object.getPrototypeOf(foo) === Object.prototype // => true
foo.toString() // => '[object Object]' - inherited from Object.prototype
foo.hasOwnProperty('x') // => true
foo.hasOwnProperty('toString') // => false
```

## Creating Prototype Links - Explicitly

There are two other ways of creating prototype links: one is direct (explicit) and the other
one is indirect (implicit). The direct way is by using [`Object.create()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create).
It will return a new object,
with it's internal `[[Prototype]]` pointing to the object provided as the first parameter. `[[Prototype]]`
can be accessed directly as the `__proto__` property, although it is recommend to use `Object.getPrototypeOf()` instead.
As mentioned before, the `prototype` property is **not** synonymous with `[[Prototype]]`.

```js
const foo = { x: 42 }
const bar = Object.create(foo) // bar is prototype-linked to foo
Object.getPrototypeOf(bar) === foo // => true
bar.__proto__ === foo // => true
bar.x // => 42 - x was inherited from foo, through the prototype chain
bar.toString() // => '[object Object]' - toString() is inherited from Object.prototype
```

### Function Objects

In JavaScript, functions are "first-class objects". This means that we can
treat them as any other object - add and remove properties, pass them as
parameters, and so on. It also means that they have `Object.prototype` in
their prototype chain; so we can call familiar methods such as `toString()`
and `hasOwnProperty()`. You probably know that function objects have a few
more tricks up their sleeve; for example, when you invoke the `call()` method
of a function object, and give it an object as a parameter, that object will
become `this` when the function is executed.

Function objects have extra capabilities because they have another object
in their prototype chain, before `Object.prototype`: [`Function.prototype`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/prototype).
That's where methods like `call()`, `apply()` and `bind()` come from. It is also
interesting to note that `Function.prototype` also has it's own `toString()`,
different from `Object.prototype.toString()`. When accessing a property on an
object, the closest one in the prototype chain will be used. This can lead to
the situation we have with `toString()`, where one property _shadows_ another
property with the same name, by virtue of being found first during the prototype
chain traversal. This is also known as _overriding_.

```js
function foo() {} // foo is a function object
foo.x = 42 // functions are objects, so we can set props on them
foo.addFive = function (n) { return n + 5 } // adding a function as a prop
foo.toString() // => 'function foo(){}'
foo.toString === Function.prototype.toString // => true
foo.toString === Object.prototype.toString // => false
```

## Creating Prototype Links - Implicitly

### The "prototype" property

When a function object is created, JavaScript will add a property to it,
"prototype". This "prototype" is an object with a single (non-internal)
property: "constructor" which is a reference back to the function. Objects
created by the function with `new` will be prototype-linked to the object at
the function's "prototype" property. So function objects have both
`[[Prototype]]` and the "prototype" property; it is important to note that
they are completely different objects.

```js
function foo() {} // foo is a function object
typeof foo.prototype // => "object" (implicitly created by JavaScript)
foo.prototype.x = 42 // linked objects will be able to access 'x'
foo.y = 100 // functions are objects, so we can set props on them; but 'y' will not be inherited
const bar = new foo() // bar is prototype-linked to foo.prototype
bar.x // => 42 - "inherited" from foo.prototype
bar.y // => undefined
```

### The `constructor` Property

We saw that when JS creates a function object, it also creates the prototype
object. This object has a "constructor" property, and it is a reference to
the function object. Because it's on the prototype, it will be inherited
by objects created by the function with `new`:

```js
function foo() {}
foo.prototype.constructor === foo // => true
const obj = new foo()
obj.constructor === foo // => true
obj.hasOwnProperty('constructor') // => false - the 'constructor' property is inherited
```

However, it's not safe to assume that if `obj.constructor === foo`, it means
the object was created by `foo`. That's because the "prototype" property of
function objects can be changed, so `prototype.constructor` can point to anything:

```js
function foo() {}
function bar() {}
foo.prototype = {
  constructor: bar
}
const obj = new foo()
obj.constructor === bar // => true - even though foo created obj
```

### Constructor Functions

In JavaScript, almost **any** function becomes a constructor when called with `new`.
As we saw previously, even a function like `function foo () {}` will still
return a new object, prototype-linked to `foo.prototype`. The most notable exception
consists of arrow functions, which cannot be called with `new`.

Just before executing a constructor call, JavaScript will create a brand new
object and it will set `this` to point to it for the duration of the
constructor function's execution. It will also set the object's internal
`[[Prototype]]` property to point to the function's `prototype`. At the end
of the execution, the return value of the function is this newly created
object; the class _instance_. JavaScript will automatically set it as the
return value. Note that this happens only if a function is called with `new`:

```js
function Foo (initialCount) {
  this.count = initialCount
}
Foo.prototype.incrementCount = function () {
  this.count++
}
const o1 = new Foo(10) // o1: { count: 10 } 
o1.incrementCount()
o1.count // => 11
const o2 = Foo(10) // o2: undefined; possible side-effect: window.count === 10
const o3 = {} // an empty object
Foo.call(o3, 10) // invoke Foo; it will run with o3 as `this`, will not create a new object
o3 // { count: 10 }
```

When we call a function without `new`, it won't implicitly create and return
a new object. So what will `this` point to, then ? Because `this` is bound at
run-time, it really depends on how the function was called. If a function is
not called as the prop of an object, and is not bound (with `bind` or with
`call/apply`) then `this` will be the global object. For browsers, that's
`window`; hence the unwanted side-effect in the example above. [More details
on `this`.](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch2.md)


## Implementing Inheritance with Function Objects

We've seen how the prototype chain can be used to enable objects to delegate
functionality to other objects; JavaScript is a dynamic, prototype-based language.
We can also use it as a class-based OO language; we've already seen some of the
hallmarks - using `new` to create new objects, the `constructor` property.

But there are a few more things that happen in class-based languages. One such thing is calling the "parent"
constructor; when the sub-class is instantiated, one would expect the
super-class constructor to be called. Therefore, we need to make sure to call
the parent function, which is also the super-class constructor:

```js
function Bar (initialCount) {
  Foo.call(this, initialCount)
}
```
We also need a way for `Bar` to inherit from `Foo`; this is done via the
prototype chain:

```js
Bar.prototype = Object.create(Foo)
```

Why not just `Bar.prototype = Foo.prototype` ? Because then the "prototype"
property of both function objects would reference the exact same object. If
you add something to `Bar`'s prototype, it would also be inherited by all
`Foo` instances. This is not desirable because super classes should not
inherit from their sub-classes.

We could also try `Bar.prototype = new Foo()`; this would also make
inheritance happen. However, this can have unwanted side-effects. Let's say
we create a `Foo` instance when the user clicks a button, and we log that
action in the `Foo` function. However, if we check the logs, we will see that
we always get an entry without the user doing anything - it's because we run
the `Foo` function to setup `Bar`'s prototype.

## Shadowing

In most cases, creating a property on an object will succeed. But there are two situations in which that will not happen,
at least not as expected. Both of them occur when JS finds an object in the
target object's prototype chain which already has a property with the same
name as the one we're trying to set/create on the target object.

### Situation 1 - The Property is a [setter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set)

In JS, if we want to run a function when setting a property, we can can use a
setter. If we're trying to set a property on an object, and another object in
the prototype chain has a property with the same name that is a setter, **JS
will call the setter**. The setter function can use `this`, which will be a
reference to the target object, _not_ the linked object:

```js
const foo = {
  set myProp(value) {
    // this function will be called when trying to set 'myProp' on:
    //   1. foo itself
    //   2. objects which have foo in their prototype chain.
    this.x = value + 1
    // this.myProp = value + 1 // DON'T DO THIS - generates an infinite loop !
  }
}
const bar = Object.create(foo) // 'bar' is the target object
bar.myProp = 10 // the setter will be called with 10 as a parameter; `this` will be 'bar'
bar.myProp // => undefined - the setter didn't create a 'myProp' property, it created an 'x' property 
bar.x // => 11
```

### Situation 2 - The Property is Read-only

We can create read-only properties using [Object.defineProperty](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty):
```js
const foo = {}
Object.defineProperty(foo, 'myProp', {
  value: 42,
  writable: false,
})
foo.myProp // => 42
foo.myProp = 100 // ignored, or throws in "strict" mode
foo.myProp // => 42
```
If `foo` is part of the prototype chain for `bar`, then we **can't set a
"myProp" property on `bar`**. In other words, a read-only prop somewhere down
the line in the prototype chain will prevent assigning a property with that
name on the target object. In `strict` mode, an exception will be thrown;
otherwise the assignment will just silently fail.

```js
// continuing previous example
const bar = Object.create(foo)
bar.myProp = 100 // nothing happens !
bar.myProp // => 42
```
This is to prevent _shadowing_ - which is what happens when two
prototype-linked objects have properties with the same name; when reading
the value of that prop, the first one will be returned, thus "shadowing" the
second one. I'm not sure why this is done _just_ for read-only properties,
but that's how it is. Essentially, it means that if an object has a 'myProp'
property that is read-only, then it can't be _shadowed_ by objects which will
add this object to their prototype chain. But, if the property is writable,
you're free to shadow it !

```js
const foo = {}
Object.defineProperties(foo, {
  'myReadOnlyProp': { value: 42, writable: false },
  'myWritableProp': { value: 10, writable: true }
})
const bar = Object.create(foo)
bar.myReadOnlyProp = 100 // can't shadow read-only props, nothing happens
bar.myReadOnlyProp // => 42
bar.myWritableProp = 100 // can shadow writable props; prop created on `bar`
foo.myWritableProp // => 10; the shadowed property is unaffected
bar.myWritableProp // => 100
```

## Summary

JS automatically adds a "prototype" property to function objects. When we
instantiate objects by calling the function as a constructor (with `new`),
the created objects will have access to properties on the `prototype` object.
One such property is the `constructor` property, added by JS and which
normally points to the function. We can create prototype-linked objects
directly, with `Object.create`.

An object's `prototype` property is **not** the same as it's internal
`[[Prototype]]` link; if the object is a function, then it's `prototype` will
become the `[[Prototype]]` of objects created when that function is called as
a constructor. We can use `__proto__` or `Object.getPrototypeOf` to get a
reference to the object referenced by the internal `[[Prototype]]` slot, and
we can use either `__proto__` or `Object.setPrototypeOf` to set it's value.

Reading the value of a property that is not on the target object will
traverse the prototype chain and return the first one found, or `undefined`,
whereas the algorithm for setting such properties is more complex, calling
the first found setter and preventing the shadowing of read-only properties.
